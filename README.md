If you can think of anymore form elements that you want, then open an [issue](https://github.com/dope/slice/issues/new) or [contribute](https://github.com/dope/slice/fork).

####Installation (lol, it's just css bro)
No crazy setup, just link the slice.css stylesheet and you're ready to go.

`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/slice.css">`

####Getting Started
Getting started couldn't be easier â€” once you've added the stylesheet then all you need to do is start adding the relevant mark up. I'm going to show you a few exmaples.

#####The Mark up
Default text input `<input type="text" class="default-input" />`

Default textarea `<textarea class="default-input">Hey</textarea>`

Text input with a label
```
<label>
  <span class="label-icon"><i class="fa fa-user"></i></span>
  <input class="default-input label-input" type="text" placeholder="Default Text">
</label>
```

How about a dropdown menu?
```
<select class="default-input option-menu">
  <option value="option-1">Option 1</option>
  <option value="option-2">Option 2</option>
  <option value="option-3">Option 3</option>
  <option value="option-4">Option 4</option>
</select>
```

Simple Button `<input class="btn" type="submit">`

Slice also has some color options which you can call by just adding the following classes:
- Blue
- Green
- Red
- Orange
- Yellow
- Purple
- Dark

Checkbox `<input class="blue" type="checkbox" name="hi">`

Radio Button `<input class="blue" type="radio" name="hi">`
